trid
====

*Trivial request ID* generator - crafts random id for a process and adds fast
sequential ids on each call. Designed for request/response logging and error 
tracking.

![pic1]

It uses `crypto` for random string generation, has no external dependencies and
is thoroughly tested in production. The reason this package has been created is
that [hyperid] (the package I originally used) has too long random parts. Also
I felt like I don't need encoding/decoding. TRID ids are url-safe and 
NATS-subject-safe.


Install
-------

```
npm i trid
```


How to use
----------

Initialize TRID with the rest of your service:

```js
const TRID = require('trid');

const id = new TRID({prefix: 'srv1', length: 4});
```

Get service instance id with `trid.base()`:

```js
console.log(`Starting server instance: ${id.base()}`);
```

```
Starting server instance: srv1.4D2m
```

Use `trid.seq()` to identify requests (as well as responses) or other activity:

```js
...
console.log(`${timestamp} ${LEVEL} [${id.seq()}] performing request...`)

```

```
...
2018-04-02T12:17:12.654Z DEBUG [srv1.4D2m.42] performing request...

```


API
---

* `new TRID({...})` - you can define the following parameters while constructing
  a trid instance:
    - `prefix` is added to the beginning of an id (default - empty string),
    - `length` of the random part (default - `5`)
    - `count` - starting sequential counter value.
  An id basically is generated like this: `{prefix}.{random}.{counter}`

* `trid.base()` - returns base part of the id (`{prefix}.{random}`). Good for
  server instance identification.

* `trid.seq()` - returns sequential id: `{prefix}.{random}.{counter}`. *Note:
  when counter reaches Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, the base value is regenerated
  and the counter is restarted*
